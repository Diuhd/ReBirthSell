You may package this with pyinstaller, but Windows Defender will most likely be able to detect it.

# How to Use:
1. Go to the Releases section, or clone the repository (git clone)
2. Use the Update.exe and enter your local IPV4 address, or change it in client/config/config.json.
3. Go to the server directory, and run server.py
4. Using any method, send the client.pyw file to the victim, and make them run it.
5. You have connected to the victim's shell. Have fun!
